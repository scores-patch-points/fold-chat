// fold-chat-self.js — what the fold says about ITSELF, and the gate that stops it LOOKING UP an ask that has nothing to look up. Pure.
//
//   selfAsk(question)          is this ask addressed to the fold itself (who/what are you, what can you do, are you an AI…)? English, DECLARED.
//   lookupWarranted(...)       does the ask carry anything to look up — a content word of its own, or a referent carried from the thread?
//   SELF_LINE / noLookupLine   the fold's own words for those two cases, app-authored (never a model, never a search)
//
// Why (user, 2026-10-06): "who are you?" was classified `research` (it opens with "who"), searched on four scopes, and answered with a 1978 album by The
// Who. The dispatcher (fold-chat.js `wantWeb`) was default-yes: every non-greeting ask searched. A lookup is warranted only when the ask has a CONTENT word
// (its words minus the language's closed class) or continues a thread (carried / elliptical / retry). Languages with no closed-class prior are not judged:
// the old behaviour stands and the result says `measured: false`.
//
// DECLARED, not measured (Constitution II.11): the self-ask patterns and both lines. Giver: the author's DRAFT of 2026-10-06, written for the user to edit
// ("what should the system say?"); SELF_LINE is the one place to change what the fold says about itself.
